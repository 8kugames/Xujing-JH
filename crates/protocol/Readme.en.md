# Xujing-JH - Communication Protocol Layer

> **中文版本**: [Readme.md](./Readme.md)

This is the game's core communication protocol library. It defines all shared data structures, message exchange formats, and error types between the server (The Way of Heaven) and agents (All Beings).

The protocol layer adopts a stateless, purely data-driven design philosophy—drawing a clean, unified boundary between the game physics engine and the AI agents.

## Usage

Add to a Rust project:

```toml
[dependencies]
xujing-jh-protocol = { path = "crates/protocol" }
# If database support is needed
xujing-jh-protocol = { path = "crates/protocol", features = ["sqlx-support"] }
```
